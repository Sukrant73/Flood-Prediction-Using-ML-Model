Disaster Prevention and Prediction: Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning

Proposed Solution:
1) Flood Prediction:
Approach 1:
To predict the occurrence of floods, a dataset will be utilized containing historical data on rainfall and whether floods occurred in specific areas, states, or cities over previous years. The dataset will include rainfall data spanning approximately three months.

Average rainfall for every 10-day interval will be calculated and visualized on a graph to identify patterns.
This average rainfall data will serve as the input for a machine learning model, while flood occurrence (yes or no) will act as the output labels.
A threshold value of average rainfall from the dataset will help train and save the model.
For prediction, rainfall data for consecutive 10-day intervals will be input into the model, which will predict the likelihood of flooding. This is framed as a binary classification problem, solved using fundamental machine learning algorithms like logistic regression or linear regression.

This approach can be extended for real-time predictions and improved accuracy by incorporating additional features such as land type, geographic location, and other environmental factors.

Approach 2:
The official website www.india-water.gov.in provides regular updates on water levels in different regions, indicating whether the area is experiencing normal flooding, severe flooding, or extreme flooding, represented by yellow, orange, and red colors, respectively.

Data from this website will be scraped periodically and stored in a database for analysis and prediction.

2) Alert System:
A warning system will be established by accessing the stored database to identify areas under threat. Alerts will be sent to residents of the affected regions via SMS using free online messaging platforms. This ensures timely notifications for evacuation and preparedness during emergencies.
